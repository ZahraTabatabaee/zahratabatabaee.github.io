## my Explanation of lots of new things

Life is very strange. Each time shows you something strange and this process never ends .

This year is my first year at university and I learned a lot of cool things this week
Everything I did not know before

And this is very attractive

But do you know where the problem is ?!

This process never ends
And there is no end to it!

But I still have hope 
The end is definitely beautiful !
