## lots of new things in this week

life is full of strange and interesting things that amaze you more than before. 
One of the interesting things is life changes.
And now at this moment in my life a great change has taken place. 
University
Something that was a big wish for me until a little while ago.
A dream that I spent all my time achieving.
But there is an interesting point, now that I have it, I have an interesting feeling.
A feeling that is both sweet and bitter.
   
To conclude,
I have heard some frightening things about the path I have taken 
I hope it is a lie :)

Hoping for good days
